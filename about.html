					<b style="color: #00b6cb; font-size: 26px">Hello there!</b>
					<br>
					I'm Jasmine, a Computer Science student with a passion for design and technology.
					<br><br>
					I have about two years of coding experience under my belt, and I'm working hard to improve my skills everyday.  
					<br><br>
					Currently, I'm on the lookout for internships.
					<br>
					I'd like to work somewhere I can utilize both a technical and creative mindset to solve problems and make an impact.

					<b style="color: #00b6cb; font-size: 30px">10 fun facts:</b>
					<br>
					<ol><small>
						<li>My family once forgot the marshmallows for a camping trip and roasted mushrooms around the campfire instead.  Since then, it's become a tradition.</li>

						<li>My philosophy: "You can love yourself while also working to improve yourself."</li>

						<li>I once won a GitHub Octocat drawing contest with only three participants.</li>

						<li>I love talking about philosophy and digging myself into existential crises.</li>

						<li>From time to time, I'll indulge in my guilty pleasure of sitting down with a tub of ice-cream for dinner.</li>

						<li>I have a habit of judging cars based on how pleasant a face the headlights (eyes) and license plate (mouth) make.  Also, when I look at houses, I see layer cakes.</li>

						<li>I think pajamas are the comfiest articles of clothing and wouldn't mind wearing them all day, everyday.</li>

						<li>When I was in high school, I played the marching glockenspiel in the Drum and Bell Corps.</li>

						<li>My favorite video games are Nier:Automata, Undertale, and Detroit: Become Human.  Common theme?  Existential crises.</li>

						<li>My go-to palette seems to consist of blue, dark blue, and even more blue.  Oops.</li></small>
